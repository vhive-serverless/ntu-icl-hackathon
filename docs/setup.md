# Instructions for setting the cluster

## Create cluster

Go to [cluster_creation.md](cluster_creation.md)

## Credentials

After creation, the credentials are available in folders `user_keys` for participants and `admin_keys` for the organizers (two additional admins). Just in case, there is a `password.txt` in `user_keys` for user passwords.

Credentials for DBs are available on master node in `ntu-icl-hackathon/scripts/mysql-redis/credentials-<timestamp>.txt`.

## Monitoring

Go to [monitoring_setup.md](monitoring_setup.md)
